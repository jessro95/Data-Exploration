# Data-Exploration

I chose heatmap to express my data, because initially, I thought there would be huge difference in fatal rates between driving under influence and driving under no influence, so i thought the huge color differences showing way more darker colors would tell the viewers my point. Although it is not greatly shown on this visualization due to data overlapping (I knew that I would have to code to average out the overlapping data, but ended up giving up on it.).
I gave options to show only data with drunk drivers, and with no drunk drivers, so that viewers can click to see the difference between accidents involving drunk driver and no drunk driver. Also I gave options to change types in y axis either to # of vehicle involved or # of people involved in the accident. This would enable viewers to tell whether the fatality rate in accident get affected by number of people involved or the number of vehicle invovled. Throught the use of this tool, I realized that the fatality rate gets really high if the accident was caused by only one person/one vehicle, and also the rate gets lower when there's more vehicles involved. And also, I learned that the accidents causing fatality could happen even in speed limit of 0.
